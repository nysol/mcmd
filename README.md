# abstract
MCMD (called as M-Command) is a set of commands that are developed
 for the purpose of high-speed processing (CSV) of
 large-scale structured data tables.
It is possible to efficiently process large scale data
 with hundred millions row of records on a standard PC
 with M-Command using a standard PC.
 Its origin can be traced back to the early 1990s.
 Y. Matsuda developed this data processing methodology
 and commands for large-scale system development projects
 which was implemented in big companies.
 The “M” in M-Command stands for his initial.

M-Command provides about 70 different commands
 where each command is specific to a single function
 (For example, sort or join tables).
 The basic tenets of what all commands have in common
 is it reads CSV data from standard input,
 and carry out a very simple processing method
 and write the results to standard output.
 It achieves a variety of processing functions
 by connecting individual commands with an inter-process stream
 called "pipe", thus the output of each process feeds directly
 as input to the next one.
 These features are the same as the UNIX philosophy.
 With M-Command, an information system can be created
 based solely using M-Command and UNIX utilities on a UNIX platform.

# Tutorial
Let’s start with a simple example.
 If you have already installed MCMD,
 confirm the following example by typing the same
 at the command line.
 Sample data is required in order to proceed with the tutorial.
 For MCMD, mdata command can be used to create different kinds
 of data set.
 In the following example, the data is saved to the file
 **man0.csv** by redirection.

    $ mdata -man0_en >man0.csv
    #END# kgData -man0_en; ; 2017/07/20 14:57:15
    $ more man0.csv
    customer,amount
    A,5200
    B,4000
    B,3500
    A,2000
    B,800

After MCMD command is executed successfully,
 it returns a status message starting with #END#.
 In addition, **more** command is a UNIX command
 to display the contents of the file one page
 at a time which allows forward navigation of the file.

Input data is a CSV text file consisting of five records,
 and each record consist of two fields namely "customer" and "amount". 
The next example below shows summarization of **amount** field
 by a key field **customer**. The **customer** fields has a suffix
 of "%0", which means the output data is sorted by this field
 (the number followed by % represents priority of sorting
 for multi-fields sort.

    $ msum k=customer f=amount i=man0.csv o=output.csv
    #END# kgsum f=amount k=customer o=output.csv
    $ more output.csv
    customer%0,amount
    A,7200
    B,8300

Let’s explore a more complex example below.
 It displays the product and corresponding quantity
 by each customer in a matrix format.
 Line comments begin with “#”.
 The function of **mcut** command only extract the specified field,
 the **mcount** command counts the number of rows,
 and mcross command performs cross tabulation on the data.
 Rather than dictating detailed processes of each command,
 the following example shows how the input data is processed
 in each command.
 M-Command consist of over 70 commands,
 a variety of data processing can be carried out flexibly
 by combining multiple commands.

    $ mdata -man1_en >man1.csv
    #END# mdata man1
    $ more man1.csv
    customer,date,item
    A,20130916,a
    A,20130916,c
    A,20130917,a
    A,20130917,e
    B,20130916,d
    B,20130917,a
    B,20130917,d
    B,20130917,f
    
	$ mcut f=customer,item i=man1.csv o=xxa
    #END# kgcut f=customer,item i=man1.csv o=xxa; IN=8 OUT=8
    $ more xxa
    customer,item
    A,a
    A,c
    A,a
    A,e
    B,d
    B,a
    B,d
    B,f

    # Count the number of rows by customer and product.
    $ mcount k=customer,item a=freq i=xxa o=xxb
    #END# kgcount a=freq i=xxa k=customer,item o=xxb; IN=8 OUT=6
    $ more xxb
    customer%0,item%1,freq
    A,a,2
    A,c,1
    A,e,1
    B,a,1
    B,d,2
    B,f,1

    # Perform a cross tabulation by the item of product. The number of the item that is not purchased gives 0.
    $ mcross k=customer s=item f=freq v=0 i=xxb o=xxc
    #END# kgcross f=freq i=xxb k=customer o=xxc s=item v=0; IN=6 OUT=2
    $ more xxc
    customer%0,fld,a,c,d,e,f
    A,freq,2,1,0,1,0
    B,freq,1,0,2,0,1
    # remove extra field "fld".
    $ mcut f=fld -r i=xxc o=output.csv
    #END# kgcut -r f=fld i=xxc o=output.csv; IN=2 OUT=2
    $ more output.csv 
    customer%0,a,c,d,e,f
    A,2,1,0,1,0
    B,1,0,2,0,1

The above example, each command outputs the result to the workfiles
 (xxa,xxb,xxc), but it can be run it without them
 by using **pipe** (connect the multiple commands
 with "|" in that order).
 Using pipe, the output of one command become the input for the next command.

    $ mdata man1_en | mcut f=customer,item | mcount k=customer,item a=freq | mcross k=customer s=item f=freq v=0 | mcut f=fld -r o=output.csv
    #END# kgData -man1_en; ; 2017/07/20 15:20:30
    #END# kgcut f=customer,item; IN=8 OUT=8; 2017/07/20 15:20:30
    #END# kgcount a=freq k=customer,item; IN=8 OUT=6; 2017/07/20 15:20:30
    #END# kgcross f=freq k=customer s=item v=0; IN=6 OUT=2; 2017/07/20 15:20:30
    #END# kgcut -r f=fld o=output.csv; IN=2 OUT=2; 2017/07/20 15:20:30
    $ more output.csv
    顧客%0,a,c,d,e,f
    A,2,1,0,1,0
    B,1,0,2,0,1
